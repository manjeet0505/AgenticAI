Gemini is Google’s family of Large Language Models (LLMs) that can perform a wide range of AI tasks such as text generation, summarization, reasoning, coding, and multimodal understanding (text, image, audio, etc.).

Using the Gemini API, you can:

1.Generate or summarize content

2.Build chatbots and assistants

3.Analyze and reason with data

Integrate AI features into web or mobile applications

⚙️ Step 1: Get Access to Gemini API

Go to the official site → https://ai.google.dev

Sign in with your Google account.

Create a new API key from your Google AI Studio dashboard
.

Copy the key and keep it safe — you’ll need it for authentication.

💻 Step 2: Install the Gemini API Client
For Python:
pip install google-generativeai

For Node.js:
npm install @google/generative-ai

🔑 Step 3: Authenticate Using Your API Key
Python Example:
import google.generativeai as genai

# Configure your API key
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

Node.js Example:
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai";

const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI("YOUR_API_KEY");

🧩 Step 4: Generate Your First AI Response
Python:
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash")

prompt = "Explain Agentic AI in simple words."
response = model.generate_content(prompt)

print(response.text)

Node.js:
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-1.5-flash" });

const prompt = "Explain Agentic AI in simple words.";
const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);

console.log(result.response.text());
